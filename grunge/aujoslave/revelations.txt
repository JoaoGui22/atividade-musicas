Revelations
Audioslave

You know what to do, you know what I did
Since you know everything just clue me in
I am such a wreck, I am such a mess
I know what I know, why don't you fill in the rest
I will bring you down, I will make it bad
While you're feelin' proud, why don't you help me

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
Your revelations
Cut me in I don't want to live without
Your revelations, revelations

You know what to say, you know what I said
You know what I dream sleeping in my bed
You hold all the keys, you know all the roads
Why don't you guide me in if I'm such a lost soul
I'm spinning 'round, I will make you ill
Since I'm so broken down, why don't you fix me

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
(I wouldn't know by now)
Your revelations
Let me in I don't want to live without
(Don't want to live without)
Your revelations

I am haunted when I am sleeping
Try to give without recieving
It's in the applebite, it's in the days and nights
In the afterlife we'll reap

Such a shame that I wouldn't know by now
(I wouldn't know by now)
Your revelations
Let me in I don't want to live without
(Don't want to live without)
Your revelations

Such a shame, such a shame
That I wouldn't know by now
Cut me in I don't want to live without
(Don't want to live without)
The revelations, revelations
