LUNCH
Billie Eilish

Oh, mmm

I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh

Call me when you're there
Said: I bought you something rare
And I left it under Claire
So now she's coming up the stairs
So I'm pulling up a chair
And I'm putting up my hair

Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been trying hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet

I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothes on the counter for you to try 'em on
If I'm allowed, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh

I just wanna get her off, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-ah-huh

She's taking pictures in the mirror
Oh my God, her skin's so clear
Tell her: Bring that over here
You need a seat? I'll volunteer
Now she's smiling ear to ear
She's the headlights, I'm the deer

I've said it all before, but I'll say it again
I'm interested in more than just being your friend
I don't wanna break it, just want it to bend
Do you know how to bend?

I could eat that girl for lunch
She dances on my tongue
I know it's just a hunch
But she might be the one

I could
Eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she
Tastes like she might be the one

I could, I could
Eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she, yeah, she
Tastes like she might be the one
