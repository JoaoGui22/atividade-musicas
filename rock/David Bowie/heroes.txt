Heroes
David Bowie

I
I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim

Though nothing
Nothing will keep us together
We can beat them
Forever and ever

Oh, we can be heroes
Just for one day

I
I will be king
And you
You will be queen

Though nothing
Will drive them away
We can be heroes
Just for one day

We can be us
Just for one day

I
I can remember (I remember)
Standing
By the wall (by the wall)

And the guns
Shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed
As though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)

And the shame
Was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them
Forever and ever

Then we could be heroes
Just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
